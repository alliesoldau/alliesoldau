# 😁 Hey, I'm Allie! 😁 

Experienced in Full Stack Development with a focus on JavaScript, React.js, and Ruby on Rails. Mechanical Engineering background with a strong desire to create elegant and efficient solutions.

Customer focused, commited to cross-functional collaboration, and dedicated to bringing projects from concept to shelf (whether virtual or physical).

When not crunching code you can find me peak-bagging in Upstate New York, crafting woodworking creations with my fiance, and spending countless hours in rainy weather volunteering with amphibian conservation groups.
