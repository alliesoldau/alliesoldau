# Hey, I'm Allie (they/them)! 😁 

Experienced in Full Stack Development with a focus on JavaScript, React.js, and Ruby on Rails. Mechanical Engineering background with a strong desire to create elegant and efficient solutions.

Customer focused, commited to cross-functional collaboration, and dedicated to bringing projects from concept to shelf (whether virtual or physical).
